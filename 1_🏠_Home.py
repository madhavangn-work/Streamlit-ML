                I am creating this app to make ML more accessible for people. While this is not a 
                ground breaking app by any means
                The objective of this app is to enable people to do ML more easily on data 
                that is available to them. I will explain 
                every part of this process in lay person terms to guide people along the way.

                Let's break down classification with a simple real-world example, and then weâ€™ll 
                talk about the target variable in both regression and classification problems.
                            
                ## Classification:
                Classification is a type of machine learning task where the goal is to categorize 
                data into different classes or groups. 
                For example, imagine you have a bunch of emails, and you want to automatically sort 
                them into two categories:
                "Spam" and "Not Spam." This is a classification problem because youâ€™re assigning each 
                email to one of two specific classes.

                ### Real-World Example: Classifying Emails

                - **Data:** You have a dataset of emails.
                - **Features:** These are the details about each email, 
                like the subject line, the sender, and the content.
                - **Target Variable:** This is what youâ€™re trying to predict. 
                In this case, the target variable is whether the email is "Spam" or "Not Spam."

                A Classification model's aim is to learn from the data and the features to classify new 
                emails correctly.

                ### Target Variable:
                A target variable is the specific piece of information that you want your machine learning model 
                to predict. It's the "answer" or "outcome" youâ€™re looking to find based on the data you have.

                ### Target Variable in Regression and Classification

                #### Classification:    
                - Target Variable: Categorical (like "Spam" or "Not Spam").
                - Example: If youâ€™re classifying fruit based on their features (color, size, shape), your 
                target variable might be the type of fruit (like "Apple," "Banana," "Orange").

                #### Regression:
                - Target Variable: Continuous (a number that can take any value).
                - Example: If youâ€™re predicting house prices based on features (number of bedrooms, square 
                footage, location), your target variable is the price of the house, which is a continuous number.
